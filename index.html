<p>“Happy Progress Day!” When I’m typing this it is currently the 2nd of April, 2025, and I’m excited to share my very first website with you!!1! I recently joined the coding club and over the past seven days, I learned the basics of HTML from my coding teacher. Thanks for stopping by and checking my website out! I unexpectedly found the process of coding and making this website really fun and interesting. I took this as an opportunity to try and show my personality on this website since I feel inspired by the websites I see on neocities. I find them super cool! (Please go and browse on neocities, it’s actually so interesting) This website is just for fun btw ( · ❛ ֊ ❛)</p>

    <p>Heyheyy, I’m Jyle. I’m currently a student. I am an ISTJ 5w6 and I love the colors blue, black, gray and white (monochrome colors). In my free time I like to listen to music, sing, journal, think, research on things I find interesting, self-reflect, observe my surroundings, take photos and sometimes play instruments whenever I feel like it. I think of myself as a very expressive person but I often keep my thoughts to myself. I think I can be very introverted at times but I try my best to push myself to talk to people more. I’m a determined person. I’m the type that won’t stop until I achieve my goal which can make me annoyingly competitive. I think of Jinx as my comfort character and think that I see myself in her because I feel like we have a lot in common. We are both determined people, like the color blue, learn fast (If we’re interested enough), always want to prove people wrong and prove our worth, smart, clever, quick, cool and we both like taking care of younger kids since it gives us comfort. I also think that I have the same vibe and personality as her even though we are complete opposites according to our mbti types(She’s an ENFP and I’m an ISTJ). I mainly listen to Beabadoobee, Grentperez, Wasia Project, Rocco, The Poles and Wave to earth. Fun fact: I can speak 4 languages which include English, Thai, Mandarin and Bisaya.
